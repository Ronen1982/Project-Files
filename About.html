                    <h3>I'm not going to start telling you about me from diaper time. We are going to fast-forward a couple of decates or so.
                        I have started University in 2003 taking Business Admin at York. After 2 years in the program I got in a serious car accident.
                        Only after 7 years after the accident I was able to go back to school, but at that time I wanted to change my major to Political Science.</h3>
                        <h3>Once graduated, only 2 years later, I commited myself to finding work that will accomodate both my physical disability and work / salery interests.
                        I have searched for almost a year, before my newly wedded wife asked me what do I think about owning a restaurant. It took me some time, but I 
                        agreed that it could be an interesting idea, which in turn, can take us out of Toronto.</h3>
                    <h3>It turns out I can cook preaty good, and I found the restaurant business to be quite challenging. 
                        In other words, I believed to have found my calling. </h3>
                    <h3>However, at the begining of 2020, COVID-19 hit us all, and I started realizing that I need to have some back-up
                        to my restaurant. Hence, I have decided to go back to school, but this time change direction and try something with computers.</h3>
                    <h3>So, that's how I got here. My goal now is to succeed in this feild, as I do need to take care of my family.</h3>
